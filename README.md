# ProgressEveryDay

My goal is to consistently learn new concepts and ideas that help me grow and enhance my understanding of software. I hope to develop this repository by adding summary notes on new topics throughout my career. The purpose of this repository is to help me retain all the information I have learned, so take a look into my brain and find some topics to delve into!

I take a lot of summary notes here, but I will often also put my learnings into an [anki deck](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which is a wonderful way to do spaced repetition learning for long term retention. Taking summary notes in combination with some form of active recollection has worked really well for me and it would be my recommendation to anyone looking to always be learning in this fast changing industry.
